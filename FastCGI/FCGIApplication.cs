    /// <remarks>
    /// This class manages a connection to a webserver by listening on a given port on localhost and receiving FastCGI
    /// requests by a webserver like Apache or nginx.
    ///
    /// In FastCGI terms, this class implements the responder role. Refer to section 6.2 of the FastCGI specification
    /// for details.
    /// 
    /// Use <see cref="OnRequestReceived"/> to get notified of received requests. You can call <see cref="Run"/> to
    /// enter an infinite loopand let the app handle everything.
    /// Alternatively, if you want to control the execution flow by yourself, call <see cref="Listen(int)"/> to start
    /// accepting connections. Then repeatedly call <see cref="Process"/> to handle incoming requests.
    /// 
    /// If you want to manage the socket connection details by yourself, or for testing purposes,
    /// you can also call <see cref="ProcessSingleRecord(Stream, Stream)"/> instead of any of the above methods.
    /// 
    /// See the below example to learn how to accept requests.
    /// For more detailed information, have a look at the <see cref="Request"/> class.
    /// If you need to fiddle with the FastCGI packets itself, see the <see cref="Record"/> class and read the [FastCGI specification](http://www.fastcgi.com/devkit/doc/fcgi-spec.html)
    /// </remarks>
