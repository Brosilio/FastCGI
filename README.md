# FastCGI for .NET

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LukasBoersma/FastCGI.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/LukasBoersma/FastCGI)

This is an implementation of [FastCGI](http://www.fastcgi.com/devkit/doc/fcgi-spec.html) for .NET, written in C#. It implements the parts of the protocol that are necessary to build a simple web application using .NET.

This means that you can write web applications in C# that serve dynamic content.

## Documentation

I am hosting the full API documentation here: [lukas-boersma.com/fastcgi-docs](https://lukas-boersma.com/fastcgi-docs/).

## Nuget

The library is available via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FastCGI/). To install, type this in the package manager console:

    Install-Package FastCGI

Or, using the command-line interface:

    nuget install FastCGI

For more information, refer to the [NuGet documentation](https://docs.nuget.org/consume).

## Basic usage

The most common usage scenario is to use this library together with a web server like Apache and nginx. The web server will serve static content and forward HTTP requests for dynamic content to your application.

Have a look at the FastCGI.FCGIApplication class for usage examples and more information.

This code example shows how to create a FastCGI application and receive requests:

```csharp
// Create a new FCGIApplication, will accept FastCGI requests
var app = new FCGIApplication();

// Handle requests by responding with a 'Hello World' message
app.OnRequestReceived += (sender, request) => {
    request.WriteBodyASCII("Content-Type:text/html\n\nHello World!");
    request.Close();
};

// Start listening on port 19000
app.Run(19000);
```

## Web server configuration

Refer to your web server documentation for configuration details:

 * [nginx documentation](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_fastcgi_module.html)
 * [Apache documentation](http://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/mod/mod_fcgid.html)

For nginx, add this to pass all requests to your FastCGI application:

    location / {
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:19000;
    }

Where fastcgi_params is a file in your nginx config folder, containing something like:

    fastcgi_param   QUERY_STRING            $query_string;
    fastcgi_param   REQUEST_METHOD          $request_method;
    fastcgi_param   CONTENT_TYPE            $content_type;
    fastcgi_param   CONTENT_LENGTH          $content_length;

    fastcgi_param   SCRIPT_FILENAME         $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    fastcgi_param   SCRIPT_NAME             $fastcgi_script_name;
    fastcgi_param   PATH_INFO               $fastcgi_path_info;
    fastcgi_param 	PATH_TRANSLATED         $document_root$fastcgi_path_info;
    fastcgi_param   REQUEST_URI             $request_uri;
    fastcgi_param   DOCUMENT_URI            $document_uri;
    fastcgi_param   DOCUMENT_ROOT           $document_root;
    fastcgi_param   SERVER_PROTOCOL         $server_protocol;

    fastcgi_param   GATEWAY_INTERFACE       CGI/1.1;
    fastcgi_param   SERVER_SOFTWARE         nginx/$nginx_version;

    fastcgi_param   REMOTE_ADDR             $remote_addr;
    fastcgi_param   REMOTE_PORT             $remote_port;
    fastcgi_param   SERVER_ADDR             $server_addr;
    fastcgi_param   SERVER_PORT             $server_port;
    fastcgi_param   SERVER_NAME             $server_name;

    fastcgi_param   HTTPS                   $https;
