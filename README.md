# FastCGI for .NET

This is a modified and maintained version of FastCGI by Lukas Boersma.

As a few breaking changes between the original version and this one were made, they are not compatible.

There are a number of steps required to move from the original version to this one.

View these changes [here.](breakingchanges.md)

This is an implementation of [FastCGI](http://www.fastcgi.com/devkit/doc/fcgi-spec.html) for .NET, written in C#. It implements the parts of the protocol that are necessary to build a simple web application using .NET.

## Documentation

I'm way too lazy to make extensive docs for this version. The original documentation by Lukas should work in most
cases, but please view the [Breaking Changes](breakingchanges.md) file to see what changed.
Entirely new features are documented [here.](docs.md)

## Basic usage

The most common usage scenario is to use this library together with a web server like Apache and nginx. The web server will serve static content and forward HTTP requests for dynamic content to your application.

Have a look at the FastCGI.FCGIApplication class for usage examples and more information.

This code example shows how to create a FastCGI application and receive requests:

```csharp
// Create a new FCGIApplication, will accept FastCGI requests
var app = new FCGIApplication();

// Handle requests by responding with a 'Hello World' message
app.OnRequestReceived += (sender, request) =>
{
    var responseString =
          "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n"
        + "Content-Type:text/html\n"
        + "\n"
        + "Goodbye, world!";

    request.WriteResponseString(responseString, Encoding.ASCII);
    request.Close();
};

// Start listening on port 19000
app.Run(19000);
```

## Web server configuration

For nginx, use `fastcgi_pass` to pass requests to your FastCGI application:

    location / {
        fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:19000; # Pass all requests for / to your FastCGI server on port 19000.
        include fastcgi_params; # (Optional but very useful): Set several FastCGI parameters like the remote IP and other metadata.
    }

For more details, refer to your web server documentation for configuration details:

 * [nginx documentation](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_fastcgi_module.html)
 * [Apache documentation](http://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/mod/mod_fcgid.html)
